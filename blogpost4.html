        <h1 class="font2">7 Hidden Gmail Features That Will Change Your Email Game</h1>
        <p class="font1">I’ve been a creative writer for seven years, mostly writing humor and fiction. The single best
            thing I’ve done to market my writing has been to focus on my craft and write as much as possible.
            <br>
            <br>
            But the second best thing I’ve done, marketing-wise, was to start an email list and a monthly newsletter.
            <br>
            <br>

            I’ve grown my email list from a few dozen friends to a modest list of more than 4,000 readers.
            <br>
            <br>

            Keeping an email list has let me consistently put my writing in front of a growing group of fellow travelers
            who like my writing and want to read it.
            <br>
            <br>

            My list has helped me to meet interesting people in other cities and other countries. Some of them have
            given me travel tips and fantastic book recommendations.
            <br>
            <br>

            I’ve made real-life friends from my list.

            <br>
            <br>
            I’ve even met a couple of literary agents directly from my newsletter.
            <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            And because my career outside of writing is running a boutique freelance marketing service, I’ve also worked
            with authors who’ve cultivated huge lists — in the tens and hundreds of thousands of subscribers — and I’ve
            seen first-hand what it does for their book sales and their careers.
            <br>
            <br>

            There are a hundred ways to market yourself as a writer, and not all of them are terrible. But I contend
            that the least terrible marketing activity you can do as a writer is to start and grow an email list.
            <br>
            <br>

            Alas, most guides to email marketing are written for businesses and online marketers. But writers need help
            here too! It’s high time for a thorough email list guide specifically for writers.
            <br>

            <br>
            Whatever you write — fiction, nonfiction, self-help articles, psychology books, humor, horror novels,
            haikus, think pieces about wine and cheese — this guide is for you. I will give you a simple, step-by-step
            process for starting your email list and turning it into a creative tool that serves your craft and your
            career.
            <br>
            <br>

            Let’s start with the ‘Why?’ Then we’ll get into the ‘How?’

            <br>
            Also, if you’re wondering what email lists have to do with giant tortoises, I’ll explain that too.
            <br>
            <br>

            1. Why should writers have an email list?
            <br>
            <br>
            To begin, let’s understand the value an email list holds for writers in general. There are four good reasons
            why most writers should have a list:
            <br>
            <br>

            (a) Email newsletters let you market by using your craft.
            <br>
            This point is fundamental, and yet I rarely see writers talk about it. The best form of marketing is the one
            that naturally harnesses your craft and might even make you better at it.
            <br>
            <br>

            The best marketing for stand-up comedians is whatever helps them send their jokes out into the world. That’s
            one reason so many stand-ups use Twitter.

            <br>
            <br>
            When you grow your audience as a writer, how do you do that on Instagram or Tik Tok? On Tik Tok, you dress
            in an inflatable T-Rex costume and twerk while holding your new book. Pretty cool!

            <br>
            <br>
            I don’t deny that social media can be fantastically useful for writers or creators. Especially if you use it
            really well. But the value of an email list to a writer is partly that growing a strong email list is
            accomplished by practicing your craft — by writing.

            <br>
            <br>
            (b) Email newsletters give you a direct, intimate connection to your readers.
            <br>
            When you email your list, you directly reach your people. Or, at least the ones who open your emails — and,
            if you have a healthy list, that should be the majority of your list.
            <br>
            <br>

            On a social platform, fuggedaboutit. You will reach a tiny fraction of your followers, and this fraction
            will wildly depend on factors outside of your control — like how The Algorithm is feeling that day. With an
            email list, you write your words, you send them out, and your followers read them. No muss, no fuss. No
            algorithm, no middleman.

            <br>
            <br>
            (c) Email is a fundamental, deep technology that isn’t going away.
            <br>
            Online platforms may wax and wane on the manias of popular culture, the vicissitudes of their algorithms,
            and the quirks and vices of their wacky CEOs. But email is a classic technology that will, in all
            likelihood, outlast us all, and that includes our future AI overlords.

            <br>
            <br>
            (d) You own your list.
            <br>
            You do not own your Twitter following or your Instagram following or even your Medium following. Social
            platforms can ultimately do whatever they please. They can change their algorithms, their news feeds, and
            their advertising models willy-nilly. But an email list is platform agnostic. You own your list for life
            (or, for as long as your contacts stay subscribed), and you can take it anywhere
            <br>
            <br>

            Think of marketing your writing on social platforms like a swarm of fruit flies: it’s fast and furious but
            ephemeral. Flies die fast.
            <br>
            <br>

            An email newsletter, on the other hand, is like a beautiful and sturdy tortoise. The slowness is the point.
            Email lists take months and years to grow. But that slow movement, steady growth, and commitment to your
            writing craft pay enormous dividends over time.
            <br>
            <br>

            If you truly commit, will you even grow a huge shell on your back? No, you will not. That’s disgusting and
            is taking the metaphor too far.
            <br>
            <br>

            The astute technology writer and best-selling author Cal Newport once said (on his podcast Deep Questions)
            that if an author could choose between owning an email list of 10,000 engaged fans or having a Twitter
            following of 500,000, the email list wins. I think he has a point.
            <br>
            <br>

            Now let’s dive into what you should actually do with your email list.

            <br>
            <br>
            2. Decide the purpose of your newsletter (and your email list)
            <br>
            The first big step is to decide what to do with your list.
            <br>
            <br>

            Is your list for promoting your new articles and stories? Is it for occasionally updating your fans about
            exciting new projects? Is it for selling your books?
            <br>
            <br>

            Or, is your list a medium for art unto itself, a place where you will publish original travelogues of
            visiting cheese caves in Switzerland, or perhaps an outlet for your spiciest erotic vampire fiction?

            <br>
            <br>
            All of those answers are good. Let’s oversimplify a bit and classify newsletters from writers into three
            general types:

            <br>
            <br>
            The “here is what’s new with me” newsletter.
            The “here are cool things I’ve discovered” newsletter.
            The “here is a valuable or interesting piece of writing that fits into some broad theme” newsletter.
            Of course, there are newsletters that mix and match two or three of these categories, and that is completely
            fine.

            <br>
            <br>
            Examples of newsletter type 1 abound, so I’ll mention examples of the other two types.

            <br>
            <br>
            Example of newsletter type 2: I’ve subscribed to Farnam Street’s Brain Food newsletter for a while. Every
            week, they send out a small handful of interesting quotations, interviews, and article links, mainly about
            decisions and mental models, though the topics vary. It’s always a pretty curious and stimulating mix, and
            I’m rarely already familiar with what they include. I think of Farnam Street’s newsletter as a high-quality
            example of a “here’s a roundup of interesting things” newsletter.
            <br>

            <br>
            An example of newsletter type 3: My former satire writing teacher Caitlin Kunkel has a newsletter called
            “Input/Output”, which is about the relationship between our creative input (what we read and watch and
            listen to) and what we create. From her description, it’s about the “waxing and waning of our creative
            cycles. Sometimes you need to be inputting more so you can output, and sometimes you need to be creating
            your own thing and limiting outside influence.” Cool idea, right? I think Caitlin’s value proposition for
            this newsletter is solid. (More on value propositions in a minute.) Most Substacks newsletters are of type 3
            by the nature of the platform.

            <br>
            <br>
            Now that we’ve covered some basic types of newsletters, let’s drop the F-bomb: Frequency.
            <br>
            <br>

            3. Choose the frequency of your newsletter
            <br>
            <br>
            Once you decide the purpose of your list, I double dog dare you to mentally commit to sending your
            newsletter at a specific frequency.
            <br>
            <br>

            This upfront commitment is extremely helpful for two reasons.
            <br>
            <br>

            First, it’s helpful for you because it turns your newsletter writing into a practice. Committing to your
            <br>
            <br>
            monthly newsletter — or whatever frequency you choose — is an instance of what Stephen Pressfield would call
            “going pro.”
            <br>
            <br>

            Second, it’s helpful for everyone who signs up for your newsletter because it sets expectations. When I sign
            up for someone’s list, I want to know how often I’ll hear from them. Here are some frequency options:
            <br>

            <br>
            Quarterly (four times per year): Emailing every three months is a minimum viable newsletter cadence. This is
            an okay option if the purpose of your list is just to let your followers know about your big projects and
            exciting creative updates. Quarterly is also a good option if you just don’t have enough free time to send
            out monthly newsletters. But any less than quarterly and you risk your list going stale and your followers
            forgetting who you are. (There are some exceptions to this if you are famous.)
            Monthly: This is the sweet spot for most writers. A monthly newsletter is frequent enough to send all your
            interesting news to your list regularly without inundating them. Personally, there are a lot of creative
            people who I’d be happy to hear from once a month, but not necessarily every week.
            Weekly (or a few times a month): Now we are talking about a frequent newsletter. Weekly (or even every other
            week) is a lot of work! The reason to send weekly is if you have some type of strong newsletter theme or
            some type of original writing that your followers can only get from your newsletter. I would only send this
            often if you can handle making your newsletter a major part of your writing routine.
            Daily (or multiple times a week): There is no reason to send this frequently unless your newsletter has a
            specific daily theme, like Anu Garg’s famous word of the day newsletter or Ryan Holiday’s Daily Stoic. 99%
            of writers should not send daily newsletters.
            To sum up: When in doubt, try a monthly newsletter. You can always adjust from there. Now it’s time to get
            your email platform.

            <br>
            <br>
            4. Pick your email platform
            <br>
            There are hundreds of email list platforms. They range from expensive and complex ones that are made for
            eCommerce companies to exceedingly simple ones like TinyLetter.
            <br>
            <br>

            I recently switched platforms. Specifically, I ditched MailChimp and did a lot of research to find a new
            platform. I’ve also done email marketing professionally for other creators and businesses. I’m well
            acquainted with various email platforms and their pros and cons.
            <br>
            <br>

            Unless you are a writer with a huge audience and you sell a bunch of online courses, you do not need a
            sophisticated, eCommerce-type email platform. So, if you are a writer reading this article, there is a 95%
            chance that the platform you need is one that is inexpensive and simple to use. For this reason, I am not
            going to discuss or recommend popular, business-oriented email platforms like Klaviyo, ConvertKit, and
            ActiveCampaign — they’re overkill for most writers.

            <br>
            <br>
            With this in mind, I’ll focus on the few email platforms that I think are actually good for most writers.
            <br>
            <br>

            Tiny Letter. A hyper-minimalist, free newsletter provider that’s designed for individuals and creatives, not
            businesses. TinyLetter is intentionally super simple, and it lacks almost every feature of other email
            platforms: no advanced reporting, no segmentation, no automation. TinyLetter works if you want to pay
            nothing and want a platform that’s dead simple. On the flip side, it can’t do much other than email your
            list. COST: Free for up to 5,000 list contacts. No paid plans and you cannot use it with more than 5,000
            contacts. (TinyLetter was purchased by MailChimp a few years ago, and so far they have kept it the same and
            not to ruined it. Keep in mind they could still ruin it.)
            Email Octopus. An elegant, easy-to-use platform with great design and a nice mix of simplicity and good
            features. EmailOctopus is my provider. I went with them after ditching MailChimp. You can create advanced
            automations, segment your list, build nice opt-in pages, and do pretty much everything a writer with a list
            would need. I love the aesthetics and usability of Email Octopus and the simplicity of their email builder.
            I recommend Email Octopus for writers who are building their lists. COST: Free for up to 2,500 contacts.
            (One of the best free plans of any paid platform.) Pro plans run $8 and up and are about 20% to 30% the cost
            of MailChimp. (Note: all links to Email Octopus are my personal referral link. It won’t pay me, but it will
            give me credit with them.)
            <br>
            <br>
            Send Fox. The email platform from Sumo, founded by entrepreneur and marketing guru Noah Kagan. SendFox is
            made for “creators” (bloggers, podcasters, etc.). SendFox has just the core email list features most
            creators use, nothing more. Worth a look if you want a simple platform with some professional features like
            automation, but you want to pay as little as possible. COST: Free up to 1,000 contacts. Paid plans start at
            $49 for a one-time, lifetime fee. There’s an optional $10–$18 monthly fee (regardless of list sizes) to
            remove Send Fox branding and add other features. Their fee structure seems wonky, but if you look at the
            details, Send Fox is probably the least-expensive paid email platform out there. Worth a look, and kudos to
            Sumo for keeping the fees so low.
            <br>
            <br>
            Mailer Lite. Possibly a good option for a writer who desires a lot of advanced email features but doesn’t
            want to pay MailChimp prices. MailerLite is the most feature-rich platform on my list, and they’ve been
            around for a long time. COST: Free up to 1,000 contacts. Paid plans are around 50% of the cost of MailChimp.
            Mail Chimp. The most popular email platform in the world. MailChimp has been around 20+ years. It used to be
            a simple, attractive platform for creatives, with a generous free plan and great design. But it has slowly
            morphed into a much more corporatized, sophisticated platform for businesses— with a gazillion features like
            multivariate testing, advanced segmentation, etc. It still has good design and aesthetics, but I think it’s
            too expensive for most writers. INTUIT purchased Mail Chimp in 2021, jacked up the price, and gave it the
            douchey, rebranded name “INTUIT MailChimp.” I am listing Mail Chimp here for comparative completeness since
            most people have heard of it. COST: Free up to 500 contacts; quite pricey for all paid plans. (A list with
            up to 5,000 contacts would run $70-$100 monthly.)
            <br>
            <br>
            Substack. Substack is not really an email platform in the traditional sense. It’s more of a hybrid between
            email and a publishing platform. In some ways, it’s like a cross between an email provider and Medium.
            Consider Substack if you plan to create regular essays, stories, or some type of valuable writing on a
            theme, and you want to build a list audience from it. Because Substack is an open publishing platform, it
            doesn’t work all that well for a traditional monthly “here’s what I’m up to” newsletter to a private
            audience. COST: Free for all list sizes.
            Tl;dr…

            <br>
            <br>
            I recommend EmailOctopus for most writers who want to build a list and send a newsletter.

            If you are tech-averse or just need something totally free and totally minimalist, try TinyLetter.

            If you want to send out some valuable and interesting writing that stands on its own and you want to do this
            fairly frequently, consider Substack (instead of a traditional newsletter).

            SendFox and MailerLite are also worth a look.

            If you feel the need to explore every option, check out 500+ email platforms on the software comparison site
            G2.

            And remember that your list is yours! If you don’t like the email platform you choose, you can always take
            your list somewhere else.

            5. Grow your email list part 1: create your opt-ins
            Once you’ve committed to your newsletter and picked an email platform, it’s time to grow your list.

            To do this, you’ll need one or more list opt-ins. Your opt-in is the form or landing page where people join
            your list. It comes in two basic varieties:

            An embedded sign-up form. This is an opt-in form that you can place on a website you control — like your
            WordPress, Squarespace, or Wix site. This could also come in the form of a pop-up or floating widget. Here’s
            what one of these looks like, from writer/podcaster Tim Ferriss:

            <br>
            <br>
            From https://tim.blog/
            A stand-alone opt-in landing page. Every email platform allows you to build a simple, stand-alone opt-in
            landing page. This landing page can be hosted by your email platform itself, so you don’t need to host a
            separate website to make one. These pages are super useful for opting people into your list from sites where
            you post (like Medium or Twitter), but where you don’t own the site code and you can’t embed a sign-up form.
            In this case, just link to your sign-up landing page. Here’s that same opt-in idea from Mr. Ferris, but as a
            stand-alone landing page. I assume he’s tested the dickens out of both opt-ins, and they work well for him.
            Value propositions: how to create a strong email opt-in
            Let’s talk about the opt-in. The cardinal sin of a bad opt-in is that it is vague and does not explain
            anything whatsoever about why anyone should join your list. You’ve surely seen too many bad, boring email
            opt-ins like this:

            “Join my list to get my updates.”
            <br>
            <br>

            Okay, but why would I want your updates? What is interesting or cool about your updates?

            These bland opt-ins don’t capture many subscribers. The one type of subscriber the bland opt-in will capture
            is someone who already loves your writing and is just dying for more of it. That person will join your
            bandwagon without any extra push. But with a boring, vague opt-in, you are making life too hard for
            yourself. When your opt-in is specific and enticing, it will push fence-sitters into joining your list.

            Example: Let’s say that you are a foodie writer/blogger who specializes in cheese. You love to travel, write
            about cheese, and introduce people to new cheeses. Here is a good opt-in:

            “Join 15,000+ cheese lovers on the Cheesemonger List.

            Once a month, I will tell you about my favorite cheese discoveries, and show you rare cheeses that make your
            taste buds explode with delight.

            “I love this newsletter! I’ve discovered so many amazing cheeses that I never knew about before!”- Gerard
            S., French Chef and Cheesemonger subscriber

            Notice what this opt-in does:

            It has a value proposition: It explicitly tells the reader what is valuable about the newsletter (discover
            new cheeses each month).
            It further demonstrates the value of the list with social proof (‘join 15,000+ cheese lovers’) and a
            testimonial (from a real chef!).
            In Tim Ferriss’s embedded opt-in (above), the reader is already on his website and has some familiarity with
            him, so the value proposition needn’t be that extensive. It’s that you can join his list to get 5 cool
            things he’s enjoying, every Friday. It’s simple, but it works.

            Bottom line: deciding what type of newsletter you want to run will help you create a concise value
            proposition for your opt-in.

            Also, you may have questions, so I’m happy to offer the following: Hit me up in the comments with a question
            about starting and growing your email list. You can let me know your particular situation if you like. For
            the first 7 days after this story goes live on Meidum, I will try to answer every question.
